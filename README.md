## Installation and Running Locally

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshitpandey08/User_Management_Dashboard.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd User_Management_Dashboard/backend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file**: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the necessary configurations (e.g., MongoDB URI).

5. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified port).

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the frontend application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The React application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the Backend Server

To run the backend server separately (if not already done), follow the backend setup steps mentioned above. Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible.
